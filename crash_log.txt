ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.

ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

ERROR: Zone mismatch.
The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).

ERROR: setState() called after dispose(): _DoctorServicesDetailScreenState#6ba2c(lifecycle state: defunct, not mounted)
This error happens if you call setState() on a State object for a widget that no longer appears in the widget tree (e.g., whose parent widget no longer includes the widget in its build). This error can occur when code calls setState() from a timer or an animation callback.
The preferred solution is to cancel the timer or stop listening to the animation in the dispose() callback. Another solution is to check the "mounted" property of this object before calling setState() to ensure the object is still in the tree.
This error might indicate a memory leak if setState() is being called because another object is retaining a reference to this State object after it has been removed from the tree. To avoid memory leaks, consider breaking the reference to this object during dispose().
